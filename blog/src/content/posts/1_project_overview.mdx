# How I Used Claude to Design a Clean Architecture

When I started this project, I knew I wanted to showcase **Event Sourcing**, **CQRS**, **Clean Architecture**, **TDD**, and **DDD**.
But knowing the concepts and actually putting them together in a real project are two very different things.

## The Problem: From Theory to Real Life

I understood each concept on its own.
But when I tried to design the full architecture, I quickly ran into big questions:

- Should budget items belong inside the Project aggregate or in a separate bounded context?
- Do I need multi-tenancy everywhere with a `workspaceId`?
- How do you actually implement saga choreography—not just explain it?

I needed guidance from someone with experience… so I asked Claude.

## The Collaboration

Instead of asking it to “build everything,” I used Claude as a **thinking partner**.

The conversation went a bit like this:

> **Claude**: “What is a Project Plan in your domain?”
> **Me**: “It’s a video planning with a timeline and status…”

> **Claude**: “Can participants exist without a project?”
> **Me**: “No.”

> **Claude**: “Does the workspace have business rules?”
> **Me**: “Yes! Free users get 2 projects max; premium users get unlimited.”

Step by step, we uncovered the real domain and its implications.

For example:

- **Budget items** stayed inside the `Project` aggregate because changing them affects project invariants.
- **Participants** stayed inside too, because their acceptance/decline changes the project state.
- **Workspace** became its own bounded context with subscription rules, enforced with a saga.

## The Final Architecture

What came out of this process was a real, well-defined architecture:

- **4 bounded contexts**
- **3 sagas**
- Clear aggregate boundaries

You can see the full details in [PLAN.md](https://github.com/JBonifay/CCPP/blob/main/docs/PLAN.md).

The system includes:

- **Workspace Context**: Multi-tenancy + subscription limits
- **Ideation Context**: Workspace-level brainstorming
- **Project Planning (Core)**: Video planning + budget handling
- **Notification Context**: Email/SMS when a project is ready

Each context has:

- Clear aggregates and invariants
- Event schemas
- CQRS with projections
- TDD examples

## Why Share This?

Because **architecture is learned by doing**, not just by reading.
If you’re learning DDD or Clean Architecture and feel overwhelmed, trust me—you’re not alone.
Using AI as a guide (not just a code generator) can really help you think through the hard parts.
