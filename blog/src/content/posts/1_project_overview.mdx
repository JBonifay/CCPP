## Project Overview

I’m starting a new project to showcase my skills in **Event Sourcing**, **CQRS**, **Clean Architecture**, **TDD**, and **DDD**.

The idea is simple: **build an app for content creator teams to plan and manage their video projects.**

### Why this project?

Creator teams often struggle to organize ideas, track progress, estimate costs, share notes, and communicate effectively. This domain is perfect for demonstrating how clean architecture and event-driven design can support real-world workflows.

### What the app will do

The first version of the app will allow teams to:

- Add and organize video ideas
- Add descriptions, notes, and important details
- Track estimated and actual costs
- Send emails or reminders related to the project
- Follow each project from idea → script → recording → editing → publishing
- Collaborate without mixing data between different teams
- View a clear timeline of upcoming content

More features will emerge as the domain becomes clearer — **I don’t know all of them yet**, and that’s part of the DDD journey.

### What I want to demonstrate

- Modeling real creative workflows with events
- Using CQRS for clarity and efficient read models
- Keeping the code clean and maintainable
- Driving the design through TDD
- Applying DDD to build a meaningful and evolving domain model
