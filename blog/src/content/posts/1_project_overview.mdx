# How I Used Claude to Design a Clean Architecture

When I started this project, I knew what I wanted to demonstrate: **Event Sourcing**, **CQRS**, **Clean Architecture**, **TDD**, and **Domain-Driven Design**.
The challenge? I didn't have the full architectural picture to make it all work together.

That's where this journey began.

## The Problem: Theory vs. Practice

I understand the concepts individually.
I've read about bounded contexts, aggregates, and event-driven systems.
But when it came to designing a real application from scratch, I found myself stuck on fundamental questions:

- Where should budget items live? Inside the project aggregate or as a separate bounded context?
- Do I need a multi-tenant layer with a `workspaceId` in every aggregate?
- How do I actually implement saga choreography, not just talk about it?

I needed an experienced architect to guide me through these decisions. Since I don't have a senior architect on call, I turned to Claude.

## The Collaborative Process

Rather than just asking Claude to "design everything," I used it as a **Socratic guide**. The conversation went like this:

> **Claude**: "What is a Project Plan in your domain?"
> **Me**: "A project is a video planning with a timeline and status..."

> **Claude**: "Can participants exist without a project?"
> **Me**: "No, they can't..."

> **Claude**: "Does the workspace have business rules?"
> **Me**: "Yes! Freemium gets 2 projects max, premium unlimited..."

Through this Q&A process (fully documented in [INITIAL_CONVERSATION.md](https://github.com/JBonifay/CCPP/blob/main/docs/INITIAL_CONVERSATION.md)), we uncovered the true domain model.
Claude helped me see architectural implications I hadn't considered:

- **Budget items** became entities inside the `Project` aggregate because changing them recalculates the project total—this affects invariants.
- **Participants** stayed inside the aggregate because a declined participant is critical to project state, not just a notification concern.
- **Workspace** became a full bounded context with business rules, requiring a saga to enforce subscription limits.

## The Result: A Real Architecture

What emerged was **4 bounded contexts**, **3 saga choreographies**, and clear aggregate boundaries—all documented in [PLAN.md](https://github.com/JBonifay/CCPP/blob/main/docs/PLAN.md).

The architecture includes:
- **Workspace Context**: Multi-tenancy with freemium/premium limits
- **Ideation Context**: Workspace-level brainstorming
- **Project Planning Context** (CORE): Video planning with budget tracking
- **Notification Context**: Email/SMS for project readiness

Each context has:
- Clearly defined aggregates and invariants
- Event sourcing strategy with event schemas
- Command/Query separation with projections
- TDD approach with example tests

## Why Share This?

I'm documenting this journey because **architecture isn't learned in isolation**. It's learned through making real decisions, understanding trade-offs, and sometimes needing guidance.

If you're learning DDD or Clean Architecture and feel overwhelmed by the gap between theory and practice, you're not alone.
Using AI as an architectural thinking partner (not just a code generator) can help bridge that gap.

The next articles will dive into implementation—starting with bounded contexts, then event sourcing patterns, and finally saga choreography.
