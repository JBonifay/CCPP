## Defining the Domain

Before writing any code for this project, I wanted to step back and understand the **real workflow of content creators**. Domain-Driven Design starts with the people who will use the system, not with classes or databases.

This post is about exploring the domain and identifying the core concepts that will shape the model later.

## Who Are the Users?

For this app, the main users are:

- **Content creators** (YouTubers, podcasters, filmmakers)
- **Team members** (editors, scriptwriters, planners, producers)
- **Collaborators** (freelancers, partners)

Each has different responsibilities, but they all share one goal:
**turn an idea into a finished video.**

## What Is a “Video Project”?

A video project is more than a title. It usually includes:

- An idea or concept
- A description and purpose
- Notes from team members
- Estimated and actual costs
- A timeline or release target
- A sequence of stages (idea → script → recording → editing → publish)

Understanding these elements early helps shape the domain language.

## The Real Workflow of Creator Teams

Through observation and assumptions (which will evolve), the workflow looks something like this:

1. Capture a new idea
2. Add descriptions, context, references
3. Estimate the work and possible costs
4. Add tasks or steps
5. Share notes or feedback
6. Communicate with team members
7. Move through stages until the video is published

Not all creators follow the same flow, but the structure is similar enough to model.

## Building the Ubiquitous Language

A shared vocabulary is crucial.
These terms will appear in commands, events, and code:

- **VideoProject**
- **Idea**
- **Description**
- **Note**
- **Cost**
- **Stage**
- **TeamMember**
- **Reminder**
- **Pipeline**

This list will grow as the domain becomes clearer.

## Starting to See Boundaries

Even at this early stage, we can already identify rough subdomains:

- **Planning** (ideas, descriptions, stages)
- **Collaboration** (notes, team members, reminders)
- **Costs** (estimations and actual spending)
- **Scheduling** (timelines, calendars)

Nothing is final yet — that’s the point. DDD encourages iteration.

## What’s Next?

Now that the domain is clearer, the next step is to:

- choose the **first aggregate**,
- write the **first events**,
- and define a **small, test-driven use case** to start the implementation.

The model will evolve naturally as we learn more.

More soon!
