# Infrastructure Setup on Ionos

This page describes the full deployment setup I use on my Ionos VPS.
It's based on **Traefik**, **Docker Compose**, **Kafka (KRaft)**, **Spring Boot Admin**, and **Spring Boot image-build**.

Everything runs inside a single network called `ccpp-network`.

# Docker Compose

Below is the full Compose file, including Traefik labels, Kafka, frontend, API Gateway, microservices, and Spring Boot Admin.

<CodeFromFile file="compose.yaml" lang="yaml" />

### Spring Boot Admin: Monitoring and Management

Spring Boot Admin provides:

- Real-time monitoring of all Spring Boot microservices
- Health status and metrics visualization
- Application logs and environment information
- Accessible at `/admin` path through Traefik

The admin server automatically discovers and monitors:

- API Gateway
- Project Planning service
- Workspace service
- Ideation service
- Notification service
