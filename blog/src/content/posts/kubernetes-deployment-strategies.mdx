# Kubernetes Deployment Strategies

When deploying applications to Kubernetes, choosing the right deployment strategy is crucial for minimizing downtime and reducing risk.

## Strategies

### Rolling Updates
The default Kubernetes deployment strategy that gradually replaces old pods with new ones.

### Blue-Green Deployments
Running two identical production environments and switching between them.

### Canary Deployments
Gradually rolling out changes to a small subset of users before a full deployment.
