# React Performance Optimization

Performance optimization is crucial for delivering a great user experience. Here are some techniques to make your React apps faster.

## Key Techniques

- **Memoization**: Use `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback`
- **Code Splitting**: Lazy load components with `React.lazy`
- **Virtual Scrolling**: Render only visible items in long lists
- **Debouncing**: Reduce expensive operations on frequent events

## Example

```jsx
const MemoizedComponent = React.memo(({ data }) => {
  return <div>{data}</div>;
});
```
